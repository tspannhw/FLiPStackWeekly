# **❄️ The Data Cloud & AI Weekly**

Date: December 15, 2025  
Theme: The Era of Agentic AI & The Open Lakehouse

## **🚀 Top Story: The Shift to Agentic AI**

The industry is rapidly moving from simple chatbots to autonomous agents. Snowflake has solidified this direction by joining the **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** and releasing new predictions for 2026\.

* **Snowflake Joins AAIF:** Snowflake has joined industry leaders like Anthropic and OpenAI in the Agentic AI Foundation to standardize the building blocks of AI agents.  
  * [Read the Announcement](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/snowflake-joins-aaif/)  
* **2026 Predictions:** The "Data \+ AI Predictions 2026" report suggests that agents will soon drive centralized enterprise strategy, moving beyond experimentation to core business operations.  
  * [Claude Blog: How Enterprises are Building AI Agents](https://claude.com/blog/how-enterprises-are-building-ai-agents-in-2026)  
* **Managed MCP Servers:** Snowflake now supports managed **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers, allowing you to securely connect AI agents to your enterprise data without complex infrastructure.  
  * [Anthropic: Donating the MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation)
