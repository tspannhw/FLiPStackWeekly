Here is your 2025 Data Engineering Wrapped.
You didn’t just stream data this year; you turned the entire physical world—from NYC traffic to paranormal sightings—into a real-time event pipeline. Based on your logs, repositories, and the tour schedule you provided, here is the definitive aggregation of Tim Spann’s 2025.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🟢 Tim Spann: The 2025 Wrapped
The Vibe: Real-Time Renaissance. While the industry was pivoting to agents, you were already there, feeding them data from traffic cams, air sensors, and ghost registries. You spent the year proving that Apache NiFi is the universal connector for the AI era.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📊 The Stats
• Total "Shows" Played: 14 Events. You mixed it up with a blend of 7 in-person appearances (NYC, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis) and 7 virtual gigs.
• Most Active Month: March 2025. You went on a tear with 4 events in one month (AAAI, Conf42, Data for Breakfast, and Realtime AI).
• Top Content Streak: You published the "All Data and AI Weekly" newsletter consistently, hitting Issue #218 by December 1, 2025.
• Code Output: You logged 3,960 commits in your weekly stack repository alone.

🌍 The 2025 World Tour
You didn't just attend conferences; you turned them into case studies. Here is your official setlist for the year:
Leg 1: The Spring Run (Q1)
• Feb 20: AI Dev World (Virtual) – Kicking off the year with AI development patterns.
• Mar 3: AAAI (Philly) – You presented "Build Secure RAG Apps With Open LLM," bringing open-source security to the AI main stage.
• Mar 6: Conf42 Cloud Native (Virtual) – Topic: "Smart Cities & Data-Driven Automation."
• Mar 11: Data for Breakfast (NYC) – Serving up data insights early in the morning.
• Mar 20: Realtime AI (NYC) – You dropped the track "Streaming AI Pipelines with Apache NiFi and Snowflake".
Leg 2: The Data Summit Sessions (Q2)
• Apr 29: Snowflake Data Engineer Connect (Online) – Connecting engineers to the Data Cloud.
• May 14: dBTA Data Summit (Boston) – You performed "From Air Quality to Unstructured Data," demonstrating how to parse environmental sensors.
Leg 3: The "NiFi Man" Tour (Q3)
• July 15: HEX Hackathon (NYC) – Solving NYC's biggest data challenges.
• Sept 12: Community Over Code (Minneapolis) – The headlining act. You debuted the "NiFi Man" persona, analyzing flight and transit data to answer: "We're here – but should we have come?".
Leg 4: The Winter Residency (Q4)
• Nov 6: NODES 2025 (Virtual) – Graph data meets real-time streams.
• Nov 21: Data Science Summit (Virtual) – Integrating LLMs into data science workflows.
• Dec 2: Snowflake NY World Tour (NYC) – A hometown show closing out the Snowflake circuit.
• Dec 9: PyData Global (Virtual) – You taught the tutorial "It's In The Air Tonight," focusing on air quality data pipelines.
• Dec 18: Conf42 IoT (Virtual) – Wrapping the year with "Building IoT Applications With Open Source".

🎵 Your Top "Tracks" (Projects)
These were the projects you had on repeat this year:
1. "TrafficAI"
• Genre: Computer Vision / Real-Time Streaming
• The Hook: You built a pipeline using NiFi to fetch images from NYC traffic cameras and used Snowflake Cortex AI (Claude 3.5) to count vehicles and describe road conditions.
• Lyric: "Analyze this traffic image and describe what you see. Respond in compact JSON format."
2. "The Ghost Registry"
• Genre: Paranormal Analytics
• The Hook: You treated ghost sightings as unstructured data. Using Streamlit and Cortex Analyst, you tracked a "Spectre Octopus" that attacks pirates in New Jersey.
• Lyric: "Every year this giant octopus comes through this house... and reenacts whatever giant octopus attack happened a long time ago."
3. "Transit Optimiser"
• Genre: Smart City Infrastructure
• The Hook: You wrote a custom processor for GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data to track buses and trains in real-time, visualizing the data to optimize travel decisions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎸 Top "Artists" (Tech Stack)
You collaborated with these technologies the most in 2025:
1. Apache NiFi: The frontman. Whether it was version 2.0, Python processors, or "NiFi Man," this was your most played tool.
2. Snowflake (Cortex & Iceberg): The venue. You moved heavily into Apache Iceberg for storage and used Cortex to add intelligence to your SQL queries.
3. Python: The songwriter. You used Python for 53% of your TrafficAI code and extensively for building custom NiFi processors.
4. Generative AI (Claude 3.5 & Ollama): The feature artist. You stopped just moving data and started asking it questions using LLMs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔮 Your Audio Aura
"The Unstructured Orchestrator."
You spent 2025 proving that data isn't just rows and columns. It's images of traffic jams, PDFs of ghost reports, and sensor readings of air quality. You broke down the walls between "streaming" and "AI," treating them as one continuous flow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analogy for 2025: You operated like a Jazz Fusion DJ. You kept the steady rhythm section of the "FLaNK" stack (Flink, NiFi, Kafka) spinning constantly in the background, but you improvised wildly over the top with new instruments like GenAI, vector databases, and paranormal sensors, creating a sound that was uniquely yours.
