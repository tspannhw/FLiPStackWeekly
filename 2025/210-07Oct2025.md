#### World Tour NYC 2025

https://www.snowflake.com/en/world-tour/nyc/agenda/

What a great event on Thursday at the Javits North.   There were so many cool partners like my friends Hex, Qlik, E&Y, Sigma, dbtLabs, Hakkoda, phData, Microsoft Azure and Astronomer.

So many interesting questions at the SnowBooth.

My talk with Ram from JetBlue was awesome.   All Lakehouse together.   Open while managed, this is the way.

After a long day we had to say goodbye for now to the Data Nation.

### **‚≠ê Spotlight: Activate Your Snowflake Data with AI Agents in 20 Minutes**

This week's major highlight is the new capability to empower AI agents with secure access to your Snowflake data assets. By leveraging Snowflake's Managed MCP Server and Cortex Agents, you can build applications that allow both technical and non-technical users to interact with your data through natural language. This significantly accelerates data-driven decision-making and unlocks new possibilities for intelligent applications.
