Timothy Spann's contributions to AI and Data in 2025 focused heavily on building and demonstrating real-time, event-driven pipelines (FLaNK stack) integrated with Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities, specifically utilizing Snowflake's AI features and open-source models.  
2025 AI and Data Contributions  
1\. Key Projects and Demonstrations ("Top Tracks")  
Timothy Spann championed three major AI and data engineering projects in 2025, transforming physical world data and unstructured data into real-time event pipelines:  
• **"TrafficAI" (Computer Vision / Real-Time Streaming):**  
    ◦ Developed a pipeline using **Apache NiFi** to fetch real-time images from NYC traffic cameras.  
    ◦ Utilized **Snowflake Cortex AI** (specifically the Claude 3.5 model) via a stored procedure to analyze the uploaded images.  
    ◦ The Cortex AI procedure was prompted to "Analyze this traffic image and describe what you see. Respond in compact JSON format," allowing the system to count vehicles and describe road conditions.  
    ◦ The code for this project comprised approximately 53% Python.  
• **"The Ghost Registry" (Paranormal Analytics):**  
    ◦ Treated ghost sightings and related reports as unstructured data.  
    ◦ Employed **Streamlit** for the application interface and **Snowflake Cortex Analyst** for querying and analysis.  
    ◦ A notable case study involved tracking a "Spectre Octopus" that attacks skeletal pirates in a New Jersey Victorian house.  
• **"Transit Optimiser" (Smart City Infrastructure):**  
    ◦ Focused on building streaming infrastructure for smart cities.  
    ◦ Involved writing a custom processor for **GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)** data to track buses and trains in real-time.  
    ◦ The goal was to utilize visualized transit data to optimize travel decisions.  
2\. Events and Talks (The 2025 World Tour)
