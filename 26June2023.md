The Capital Grille

Also live streamed to Youtube

This will be a hybrid event with a Zoom. The in-person event will be in Milwaukee.

In this interactive session, Tim will lead participants through how to best build streaming data pipelines. He will cover how to build applications from some common use cases and highlight tips, tricks, best practices and patterns.
He will show how to build the easy way and then dive deep into the underlying open source technologies including Apache NiFi, Apache Flink, Apache Kafka and Apache Iceberg.
If you wish to follow along, please download open source projects beforehand. You can also download this helpful streaming platform: https://docs.cloudera.com/csp-ce/latest/installation/topics/csp-ce-installing-ce.html
All source code and slides will be shared for those interested in building their own FLaNK Apps. https://www.flankstack.dev/

**This is Issue #91 **

You may notice a version jump, Linked in says we had 89 already, so I am assuming two other articles got assimilated.   I will go with this, since 90 is a better number.
